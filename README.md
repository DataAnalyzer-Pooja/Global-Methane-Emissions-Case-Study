# Global-Methane-Emissions-Case-Study
This project focuses on the comprehensive exploration of global methane emission data to uncover valuable insights about the sources, trends and impact of emissions worldwide.  
Welcome to the methane emission data analysis case study as a part of the Portfolio Project of DataAnalyzer-Pooja. 

# Problem Statement 
Rising levels of methane gas across the globe have become a topic of concern alongside the carbon dioxide gas. Despite its lower contribution to global warming and shorter lifespan in atmosphere, methane absorbs much more sun energy as compared to carbon dioxide. Methane is over 25 times more powerful at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Over the last two centuries, methane concentrations in the atmosphere have more than doubled majorly due to the human-related activities. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address this issue by understanding the sources, trends and patterns of methane emissions globally. The project aims to explore the methane emissions, identify sectors that impact its release and propose effective strategies to mitigate climate change. It also aims to raise awareness about the importance of reducing methane emissions for a greener future.

# About Dataset
Dataset used in this project has been downloaded fro Kaggle. Dataset contains time-series data ranging from 1990 to 2018, having information on methane emissions across various countries and sectors globally. This dataset helps us to understand how methane emissions have evolved over years and which areas and industries contributes the most. By analyzing this data, we can gain valuable insights to tackle the problem of methane emissions and work towards reducing its impact on the environment.

# Business Task
 Use this dataset for data cleaning, exploration and visualization to uncover the emission insights. Following questions needed to be answered by this analysis.
 1. How have methane emissions evolved globally from 1990 to 2018?
 2. Which countries have shown the highest increase in methane emissions over the time period?
 3. What are the major sectors contributing to methane emissions worldwide?
 4. Is there a noticeable trend in methane emissions across different sectors?
 5. How has the distribution of methane emissions from different sectors changed over the years?
 6. Are there any specific years that that have seen significant changes in methane emissions?
 7. What are the levels of methane emissions in India across different sectors?

# Deliverables
The project includes the following:-
- CSV [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/methane-emissions-across-the-world-19902018).
- Post cleaned Excel file
- PowerPoint [presentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1IaUE785mMRg--RPuXPMxwqW7h6Ayp_OJ).

# Process
- Filtered each column to investigate the existence of non-numeric values in numeric columns.

# Findings & Recommendations has been enclosed in the attached presentation. 

I hope this project helps you understand the methane emission trends. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
