# Global-Methane-Emissions-Case-Study
This project focuses on the comprehensive exploration of global methane emission data to uncover valuable insights about the sources, trends and impact of emissions worldwide.  
Welcome to the methane emission data analysis case study as a part of the Portfolio Project of DataAnalyzer-Pooja. 

# Problem Statement 
Rising levels of methane gas across the globe has become a topic of concern apart from carbon dioxide. Despite its contribution in global warming is lower and it also stays for less duration in atmosphere but it absorbs much more sun energy as compared to carbon dioxide gas. Methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Over the last two centuries, methane concentrations in the atmosphere have more than doubled majorly due to the human-related activities. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address this issue by understanding the sources, trends and patterns of methane emissions across the globe. The objective of this project is to explore the methane emissions, identify a list of sectors influencing its release, and propose effective strategies for mitigating methane emissions to mitigate climate change and promote environmental sustainability.



The objective is to understand the sources and trends of methane emissions globally and identify effective strategies to mitigate its release. By analyzing the patterns and factors influencing methane emissions, this project seeks to contribute towards developing sustainable solutions and raising awareness about the importance of reducing methane emissions for a greener future.

# About Dataset
Dataset used in this project contains time-series data ranging from 1990 to 2018, having information on methane emissions across various countries and sectors globally. This dataset helps us to understand how methane emissions have evolved over years and which areas and industries contributes the most. By analyzing this data, we can gain valuable insights to tackle the problem of methane emissions and work towards reducing its impact on the environment.

# Business Task
 Use this dataset for data cleaning, exploration and visualization to uncover the emission insights. Following questions needed to be answered by this analysis.
