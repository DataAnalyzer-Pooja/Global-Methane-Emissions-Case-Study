# Global-Methane-Emissions-Case-Study
This project focuses on comprehensive exploration of global methane emission patterns to uncover valuable insights about the sources, trends and impact of emissions worldwide.

Welcome to the methane emission data analysis case study as a part of the Portfolio Project of DataAnalyzer-Pooja. 

# Problem Statement 
Rising levels of methane gas across the globe has become a topic of concern apart from carbon dioxide. Thouh everybody talks about carbon dioxide when it comes to greenhouse gases (GHG), however we need to consider the 2nd most important GHG which is methane because it has stronger effect on the climate. 
This means that even though there is less methane in the atmosphere compared to CO2, it still causes a lot of warming. The objective is to understand the sources and trends of methane emissions globally and identify effective strategies to mitigate its release. By analyzing the patterns and factors influencing methane emissions, this project seeks to contribute towards developing sustainable solutions and raising awareness about the importance of reducing methane emissions for a greener future.

The problem at hand is the rising levels of methane emissions worldwide and its adverse impact on climate change. Methane, as the second most important greenhouse gas, poses a significant threat due to its potent warming effect. Despite its lower concentration in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide, methane contributes substantially to global warming. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address this issue by understanding the sources, trends, and patterns of methane emissions across the globe. The objective of this project is to explore the complex nature of methane emissions, identify key factors influencing its release, and propose effective strategies for mitigating methane emissions to mitigate climate change and promote environmental sustainability.

# About Dataset
Dataset used in this project contains time-series data ranging from 1990 to 2018, having information on methane emissions across various countries and sectors globally. This dataset helps us to understand how methane emissions have evolved over years and which areas and industries contributes the most. By analyzing this data, we can gain valuable insights to tackle the problem of methane emissions and work towards reducing its impact on the environment.

# Business Task
 Use this dataset for data cleaning, exploration and visualization to uncover the emission insights. Following questions needed to be answered by this analysis.
